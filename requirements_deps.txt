# Cairo library (with the required DLL) needs to be installed separately, I think.
# The "CFFI" can be delivered by Conda, 
# while libcairo-2.dll can be provided by [Alexander Shaduriâ€™s GTK+ installer](https://gtk-win.sourceforge.io/home/index.php/Main/Downloads)
# (GTK+ uses cairo, so installing GTK+ will also install Cairo)
